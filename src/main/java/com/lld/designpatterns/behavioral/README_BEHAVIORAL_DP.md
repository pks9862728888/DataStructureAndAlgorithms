## Behavioral design patterns <hr />
### Visitor design pattern <br />
- Use this pattern when you want to abstract away code in concrete implementation rather than in domains
- Without this for adding new feature we would have to touch all classes
- With visitor, only the new visitor needs to be changed
- Alternatively we can use adapter design pattern
